# Code style

## Typescript & Javascript

### Immutability
1. Always use immutable methods
2. Immutability has priority over performance

### Functional programming
1. For arrays operations always prefer map, filter, reduce over for loops
2. For side effects and only then forEach() is possible

### Typing
1. Arrays are never optional. If no data, then this property has empty array 
   value
